:white_medium_square:	 I love translating numbers into insights, solving problems, and making data-driven decisions that create real impact.  
:white_medium_square:	 Some of my proudest achievements include leading a project that boosted sales by 202% and building a Power BI dashboard that improved decision-making across departments.
